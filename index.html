                  <p>Enrolled for Computer science & Engineering Course. I'm freshers on this industry and experience with them is absolutely great. Class instructor was very good in explaining everything and he explained many times if we had asked for. Assignments and quiz helps to get the practical experience. Support team is also very helpful and always available to help you with assignments/technical doubts. Overall its a good course to take</p>
